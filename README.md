## About SOLID

SOLID is an acronym that represents five principles very important when we develop with the OOP paradigm, in addition it is an essential knowledge that every developer must know.
Understanding and applying these principles will allow you to write better quality code in terms of usability, flexibility and Maintainability.

## SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.
- **Open Closed Principle (OCP):** The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.
- **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** This principle was defined by [Barbara Liskov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov) and says that objects must be replaceable by instances of their subtypes without altering the correct functioning of our system.
- **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** This principle defines that a class should never implement an interface that does not go to use. Failure to comply with this principle means that in our implementations we will have dependencies on methods that we do not need but that we are obliged to define.
- **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** The Dependency Inversion Principle means that a particular class should not depend directly on another class, but on an abstraction (interface) of this class.
